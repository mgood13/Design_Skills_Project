Any ideas related to the physical design of the device.


Button/Slider
- What if you could use a similar concept to that used in a multimeter to 5 position input?
Challenges:
	- Need to design a slider
	- Need to create design for the ridges to keep the slider in place
	- Need to find a way to attach the locations on the slider to the circuit
